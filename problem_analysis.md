# Image Support Issues Analysis

## 🔍 Current Status
- ✅ **Pollinations.ai models work** with small images
- ❌ **A4F.co models fail** with vision requests
- ❌ **PayloadTooLargeError** with larger images

## 🎯 Root Causes Identified

### Problem 1: A4F Vision API Format Issue
- **Issue:** A4F.co models returning "Invalid request format for AI service"
- **Cause:** A4F vision API may require different request format than Pollinations
- **Solution:** Fix A4F vision request format according to their docs

### Problem 2: PayloadTooLargeError for Large Images
- **Issue:** Large images still trigger PayloadTooLargeError despite 50MB limit
- **Cause:** Multiple possible middleware ordering or configuration issues
- **Solution:** Fix middleware ordering and add raw body parser

## 🛠️ Action Plan
1. Fix A4F vision API request format
2. Fix PayloadTooLargeError with proper middleware configuration
3. Test both APIs with various image sizes
4. Finalize implementation

## 📊 Expected Outcome
- All vision models work with images of any reasonable size
- Both Pollinations and A4F APIs support vision properly
- Robust error handling for all scenarios
