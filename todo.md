# Todo List

This file outlines the recommended next steps for the Fronix AI Chatbot project.

## 1. Frontend Refactoring

- [ ] **Componentization**: Break down the monolithic `index.html` into smaller, reusable components. This will improve maintainability and allow for more efficient development.
- [ ] **State Management**: Implement a dedicated state management library (e.g., Redux, Vuex, or similar) to manage the application's state more effectively. This will reduce complexity and make the codebase easier to reason about.
- [ ] **Build Process**: Introduce a build process (e.g., with Webpack or Vite) to bundle and optimize the frontend assets. This will improve performance and enable the use of modern JavaScript features.

## 2. Backend Enhancements

- [ ] **Error Handling**: Improve the error handling in the backend to provide more meaningful error messages to the frontend.
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Implement input validation for all API endpoints to ensure data integrity and prevent security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Generate API documentation (e.g., with Swagger or OpenAPI) to make it easier for developers to understand and use the API.

## 3. General Improvements

- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Move all hardcoded configuration values (e.g., API keys, database credentials) to environment variables. This will improve security and make it easier to configure the application for different environments.
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Regularly review and update the application's dependencies to ensure they are secure and up-to-date.
- [ ] **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing and deployment process. This will improve the development workflow and ensure that the application is always in a deployable state.
