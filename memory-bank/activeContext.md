# Active Context: Fronix.ai

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on debugging and fixing the Model Selector functionality. The user has reported that it is not working as expected.

## Recent Changes

The streaming functionality has been fixed by replacing the old, broken functions with the new, corrected ones and removing the overwriting code block.

## Next Steps

The next step is to test the application to ensure all features are working as expected, and then to diagnose and fix the Model Selector. This will likely involve using the browser's developer tools to check for console errors, inspect the DOM, and debug the JavaScript code.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The root cause of the issue is unknown. It could be a JavaScript error, a CSS issue, or a problem with the application's state management.
- The investigation should be systematic, starting with the most likely causes and progressing to more complex ones.
