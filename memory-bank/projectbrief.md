# Project Brief: Fronix.ai

## Core Requirements and Goals

Fronix.ai is a web-based chat application that allows users to interact with various large language models. The primary goal is to provide a clean, intuitive, and customizable user interface for seamless conversations.

The application should:
- Allow users to create, rename, and delete chats.
- Persist chat history and user settings in the browser's local storage.
- Support multiple language models through a model selector.
- Feature a light and dark theme.
- Allow users to customize the font and font weight.
- Provide a responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Scope

The project is currently a single-page application built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and vanilla JavaScript. The focus is on the front-end implementation. The back-end is handled by a third-party API endpoint.
