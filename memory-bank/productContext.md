# Product Context: Fronix.ai

## Problem Solved

Fronix.ai aims to solve the problem of fragmented and inconsistent user experiences when interacting with different large language models. By providing a unified interface, users can seamlessly switch between models without having to learn a new UI for each one.

## How It Should Work

The application should be intuitive and easy to use. Users should be able to start a new chat, select a model, and begin conversing with the AI. The chat history should be easily accessible, and the user should have control over their data (persisted in local storage).

## User Experience Goals

- **Seamless:** The user experience should be smooth and free of friction.
- **Intuitive:** The UI should be easy to understand and navigate.
- **Customizable:** Users should be able to personalize the application to their liking (theme, font, etc.).
- **Responsive:** The application should work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
