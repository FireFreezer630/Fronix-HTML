# Performance Fix Plan

This document outlines the plan for fixing the caching implementation and improving the application's performance.

## 1. The Problem

The current caching implementation is not working as expected, and the application's performance has not improved. This is because the caching logic is flawed, and the frontend is not correctly utilizing the cached data.

## 2. The Solution

To fix this, we will implement the following changes:

1.  **Add Logging**: We will add logging to the backend to provide visibility into the caching process. This will help us to identify and debug any issues with the caching logic.
2.  **Correct the Caching Logic**: We will rewrite the caching logic to ensure that it correctly fetches and caches all of a user's data, including chats and messages.
3.  **Refactor the Frontend**: We will refactor the frontend to ensure that it correctly utilizes the cached data.

## 3. Implementation Steps

1.  **Add Logging**:
    -   In `Backend/routes/user.js`, add `console.log` statements to the `/api/user/pre-fetch` endpoint to log the email address of the user whose data is being cached.
2.  **Correct the Caching Logic**:
    -   In `Backend/routes/user.js`, rewrite the `/api/user/pre-fetch` endpoint to correctly fetch and cache all of a user's data.
    -   In `Backend/routes/auth.js`, adjust the `/api/auth/signin` endpoint to retrieve the comprehensive user data from the cache.
3.  **Refactor the Frontend**:
    -   In `index.html`, refactor the `loadDataFromServer` function to first check if the user's data is already available in the application's state before making a network request.

## 4. Todo List

- [ ] Add logging to the backend to provide visibility into the caching process.
- [ ] Correct the caching logic to ensure that it correctly fetches and caches all of a user's data.
- [ ] Refactor the frontend to ensure that it correctly utilizes the cached data.
- [ ] Review and Deploy: Test the bug fixes and deploy the changes.
